Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack
-------------------------------------------


Vendor: Vsourz Digital

Wordpress Plugin Versions: Advanced Contact form 7 DB - 1.7.2, 1.9.1

Type: Remote attack



We have identified that the “Advanced Contact form 7 DB - 1.7.2, 1.9.1” Wordpress Plugin Versions are vulnerable to Reflective Cross-site scripting (XSS). This is due to that the Web App fails to sanitize HTML/JavaScript code on the server-side. By leveraging this issue, an attacker is able to cause arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code to be executed in a user's browser (e.g. admin) within the security context of the affected site. This attack can be used in conjunction with a social engineering techniques.

We have managed to bypass the client-side protection (URL Encoding) by intercepting the GET HTTP request using an HTTP proxy tool, and then inserting the XSS payload. Also, we have bypassed the server-side protection (Backslash Escaping) using backticks instead of single or double quotes.


Below, evidence is provided.
